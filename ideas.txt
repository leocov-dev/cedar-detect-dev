Map hot pixels with a dark exposure.
  Benefit: Can run with tight focus (don't need to insist on a spread to
    adjacent pixels). This can yield marginally higher signal to noise by
    concentrating all of a star's intensity into a single pixel, allowing
    for marginally shorter exposures.
  Drawback: Adds a workflow complication, need the user's involvement in
    capturing the dark frame.

Investigate subtracting dark frame to reduce fixed pattern noise. Will this
allow better star detection by eliminating fixed pattern component of noise?
Can build up a dark frame from operational frames over time, for different
pointings.

When calling compute_moments() on full res image when binning was used for star
detection, pass in a map of hot pixels detected during the binning. This will
allow compute_moments() to replace hot pixels during the moment calculations.
