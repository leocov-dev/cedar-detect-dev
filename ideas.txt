Map hot pixels with a dark exposure.
  Benefit: Can run with tight focus (don't need to insist on a spread to
    adjacent pixels). This can yield marginally higher signal to noise by
    concentrating all of a star's intensity into a single pixel, allowing
    for marginally shorter exposures.
  Drawback: Adds a workflow complication, need the user's involvement in
    capturing the dark frame.


When calling compute_moments() on full res image when binning was used for star
detection, pass in a map of hot pixels detected during the binning. This will
allow compute_moments() to replace hot pixels during the moment calculations.
