Map hot pixels with a dark exposure.
  Benefit: Can run with tight focus (don't need to insist on a spread to
    adjacent pixels). This can yield marginally higher signal to noise by
    concentrating all of a star's intensity into a single pixel, allowing
    for marginally shorter exposures.
  Drawback: Adds a workflow complication, need the user's involvement in
    capturing the dark frame.


During scan_image_for_candidates(), we can cheaply compute the 2x2 binning of
the input image, while healing hot pixels. The binned image can then be itself
passed to scan_image_for_candidates(), turning off hot pixel detection. Benefit:
if full-res input doesn't yield stars because camera is moving, the 2x lower
resolution image's streaks might be small enough to allow star detections. IOW,
we get 2x the motion tolerance. And while processing the 2x2 binned image, we
can bin again to 4x4 binned, and again search for stars with now 4x motion
tolerance.

Question: How low can the image resolution go before Tetra3 fails?

But: this won't work? Consider an unbinned image exposed such that a star is
mostly concentrated in one pixel, and at the edge of detection. Now apply 2x2
binning. The star's intensity drops by 4x; the noise background drops by sqrt(4)
or 2x. Thus our SNR drops 2x, and if the original image had the star at the
edge of detection, we'll lose it at 2x2 binning. And so we'll need to increase
the exposure time, and thus incur more motion streaking?

Need to play with this in practice to see the effect binning has on detection
threshold...
