Map hot pixels with a dark exposure.
  Benefit: Can run with tight focus (don't need to insist on a spread to
    adjacent pixels). This can yield marginally higher signal to noise by
    concentrating all of a star's intensity into a single pixel, allowing
    for marginally shorter exposures.
  Drawback: Adds a workflow complication, need the user's involvement in
    capturing the dark frame.


During scan_image_for_candidates(), we can cheaply compute the 2x2 binning of
the input image, while healing hot pixels. The binned image can then be itself
passed to scan_image_for_candidates(), turning off hot pixel detection. Benefit:
if full-res input doesn't yield stars because camera is moving, the 2x lower
resolution image's streaks might be small enough to allow star detections. IOW,
we get 2x the motion tolerance. And while processing the 2x2 binned image, we
can bin again to 4x4 binned, and again search for stars with now 4x motion
tolerance.

Question: How low can the image resolution go before Tetra3 fails?
